LaughingLeader's Divinity Mod Manager
=======

A work-in-progress mod manager for Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition.

# Setup

1. Make sure you have [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) installed
2. [Grab the latest release.](https://github.com/LaughingLeader-DOS2-Mods/DivinityModManager/releases/latest/download/DivinityModManager_Latest.zip)
3. The Divinity Mod Manager is portable, so extract it wherever you wish.
4. Upon opening the program, pathways to the game data and exe should be automatically detected. If this fails, you can manually set the pathways in Settings -> Preferences.
5. Organize your active mods for a given profile, then click the first export button (Export Load Order to Game), or click File -> Export Order to Game, to export your active load order to the game.
